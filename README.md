# SigmaCode

A live demo can be found [here.](https://sigmacode.netlify.app/).

## What does this do?

SigmaCode is a tool for IB computer science students to run their pseudocode. Because IB has a specific pseudocode syntax, there are few tools to use in order to see the results of the pseudocode. Shorting the feedback loop for CS students, from every exam to every ten minutes, means that they are able to get much more comfortable writing pseudocode, and can score higher on their exams. 

## What technologies or tools were used?

This website was created primarily in Tailwind CSS and React JS. It takes the IB pseudocode and then (scrappily) translates that into javascript.
